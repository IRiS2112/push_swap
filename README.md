# PushSwap

PushSwap is a sorting algorithm project. The program is designed to sort a list of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of operations used to sort the list.

## Description

PushSwap sorts a list of integers with the following operations:
  * Push: Moves the top element from one stack to the other.
  * Swap: Swaps the top two elements of a stack.
  * Rotate: Shifts all elements in a stack up by one position.
  * Reverse Rotate: Shifts all elements in a stack down by one position.

The program should produce an optimized solution, using the least number of operations possible to sort the list.
